# Maryk Core

The Maryk Core project is the heart of the Maryk library, providing a comprehensive
set of tools for creating structured, type-strict data models, and querying, parsing,
and serializing this data in a variety of formats. This project includes everything
from data model definition, properties, versioning, queries, filters, and serialization
support for YAML, JSON, and ProtoBuf.
